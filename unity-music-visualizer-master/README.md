# Unity Music Visualizer Basic Project 2018

Here is a simple project that show you how you can use native Unity features to create a music visualizer. I personally use this to create my music videos for Youtube. For sure, i have already improved that basic project a little and modified it for myself. But to get you in the right direction, i uploaded the base for free here on GitHub. MIT License for sure, so use it however you want.

You can find a ready to use binary download for windows in the [releases](https://github.com/brainfoolong/unity-music-visualizer/releases/latest) section. This is the improved version but it also contains a little watermark.

If you want donate a few bucks for my work, feel free to check this out: https://paypal.me/brainfoolong

The integrated music track is my own and is free to use.

Project was initially made with Unity 2017.3.1f1 and should be compatible with any further version and also probably with some versions before.

# Installation

* Git clone or download zip and extract to a directory

# How to record this for my music videos?

There is no built in solution as video recording as very complex to get done right in Unity. I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com). It's also free to download.
